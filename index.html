                    My name is Jonathan Cruz. I am 20 years old and have been learning web
                    development for about 6 months. My interest in programming grew when I
                    learned that video games involved code. This eventually gave me a desire to
                    learn about programming. Although my understanding of programming has just started,
                    my curiosity will forever linger in what computer could do.</h3>

                <h3>The very first time I realized what programming was, was when I entered a Call
                    of Duty lobby and all the players were moving abnormally. By abnormally, I mean
                    everyone was running really fast and jumping really high. This was done by someone
                    modifying the code of the video game. This moment made my mind wonder about the things
                    that could be accomplished by programming.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    Long after that moment in life where programming drew my interest, as I grew older...
                    The time came where I needed to make money and live on my own. After working
                    countless hours as a caregiver, not being appreciated for the hardwork put in,
                    I decided I needed a change. Thats when my dreams from my younger age came back
                    and I decided to actually try programming. Turns out that programming is quite fun,
                    and some of the languages I've learned are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, mysql,
                    Sequalize, and MongoDB. My knowledge these for programming is very vast,
                    but my curiosity will lead me to learn more.
