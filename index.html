                It may not be obvious at first, but my name is Jonathan Cruz. I have many interests, 
                but I believe one of the most interesting things on earth are animals. I myself only 
                have two pets. Another of my interest is art. My art skills aren't great but art has 
                been something that has always caught my attention. Lastly, the very thing that has sparked 
                my interest in coding... Video Games. The moment I realized coding was how video games were 
                created, my interest into coding grew.

                I have two pets: an axenthic iguana, and an asian forest 
                scorpion. They're both still very young and can be very annoying at times.

                The moment I joined a match of Call of Duty and everyone was moving abnormally. As in abnormally, 
                I mean everyone was jumping really high and running extremely fast. I looked into it and figured 
                out that the people doing this were hackers(or modders). So in conclusion, coding is required to 
                mod. Although wemay not learn how to mod in this class, this would be a good starting point for 
                me.
